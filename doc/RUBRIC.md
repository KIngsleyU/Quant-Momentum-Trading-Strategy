# Instructions
Submitting your work amounts to committing changes you have made in this repository (add-commit-push).  

Each directory contains files corresponding to an assignment. Edit / add to the files in each assignment folder and commit the changes as you go. The commit messages should summarise the changes (e.g. "Added Sharpe Ratio calculation to performance evaluation function", not "Updated a1.R").

XKCD provides some great (and horrific) examples:

Make sure you push your final commit before the submission deadline (23:59 on the due date, unless otherwise noted).


## Code Grading Rubric

| Weight   | Criteria                     | Excellent (5)                                                                                                                                  | Fair (3-4)                                                                                                           | Unsatisfactory (1-2)                                                                                                  |
|---------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **20%** | **Specifications**       | The program works and produces the correct outputs, such as log returns, charts, statistics.                                               | The program works and produces some correct outputs                                                                | The program does not run or produces mostly incorrect outputs                                                        |
| **10%** | **Style/Readability**    | The code completely follows the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) for coding conventions                                                                 | The code is somewhat organized and mostly respects the style guide                                                  | The code has no apparent organization and ignores the style guide                                                    |
| **10%** | **Reusability**          | The code is parametrized and packed into functions whenever possible. It would be easy to recycle the program either in its entirety, or dissect it for parts | The code has some parametrization but requires some customization before it could be re-appropriated for other projects | Most inputs are hard-coded in. Recycling the code does not do much better than restarting from scratch                |
| **10%** | **Documentation**        | Documentation is well written and clearly explains what the code does and how. Embedded comments can be extracted to form pseudo-code         | There is some commenting and section headers that help the user figure out what the code is trying to accomplish.     | There is little documentation and the embedded comments do little to help the reader reconstruct the program          |
| **50%** | **GitHub**            |  All incremental changes have their own, separate commits. Commit message meaningfully summaries the changes.         | There are some large commits that lump multiple tasks together. Commit messages still meaningfully describe changes.         |   Many large commits grouping many changes together. Commit messages are vague, or do not communicate much beyond the fact that changes were made                           |
